# Sequence-Detector-
Implemented a Sequence Detector in VS Code using Icarus Verilog and has verified its functionality
REQUIRED TASK: Design and implement a sequence detector that meets the following specifications: 
       The detector contains single input 'w' and output 'z'. 
       All changes in the circuit occur on the positive edge of a clock signal. 
       The output 'z' is equal to '1' if input 'w' receives sequence "01111110" in the immediately preceding clock cycles.
